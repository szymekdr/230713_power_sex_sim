# Power of two-sex models without and with sex variance heteroscedasticity

Simulations build on the paper Phillips et al. (2023) Statistical simulations show that scientists need not increase overall sample size by default when including both sexes in in vivo studies. PLoS Biol 21(6) 3002129 [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002129). The aim is to show that heteroscedasticity in the (nuissance) variable in a model testing for some treatment-of-interest effect does indeed lead to  drops in power and mandates increased sample size (often as much as twofold increse).
